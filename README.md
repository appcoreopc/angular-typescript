Sample application using Angular 1.x with Typescript, Gulp and bower.

## Getting started
- Make sure you have NodeJS, Bower and git installed.
- From the project folder execute
```
npm install
bower install
```
- Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:
```
npm install -g gulp
```
- Ensure that [Bower](http://bower.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:
```
npm install -g bower
```
- To run the app, execute the following command:
```
gulp watch
```
- Browse to [](http://localhost:9000/) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under src and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.
