# angular-typescript
Sample application using Angular 1.x with Typescript, Gulp and bower.

## Its still work in progress!
There are several stuff which needs to be worked on, so until its ready please bare with me.
### Tasks to do
 - implement work flow for SCSS
 - make it look a little bit sexy
 - make a more polished sample with some data, navigation etc...

## Getting started
- Make sure you have NodeJS, Bower and git installed.
- From the project folder execute
```
npm install
bower install
```
- Temporarily fix
Copy the bower_components folder and paste them in build, to get it working
- Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:
```
npm install -g gulp
```
- Ensure that [Bower](http://bower.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:
```
npm install -g bower
```
- To run the app, execute the following command:
```
gulp watch
```
- Browse to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under src and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.
